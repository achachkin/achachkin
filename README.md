# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @achachkin
## I wrote an explanation in the question and answer form, I hope you understand
---
### what is this program?  
This is a small program in js where the physics of a car with a trailer is written

### how to run it?  
to start download the files and run the html document

### what do each of the files mean?  
1) html - this is the file to run the program  
2) physics - file where to find all physics related code  
3) de_physics - file where the physics file health check is stored  
4) image - file that contains everything related to the image  
5) simulation - file that combines physics and image  

### i want to change physical constants how to do it?  
all physical constants are stored in the simulation file, each of them is marked, you can change any

### why create a de_physics file?  
first I wrote the code check in de_physics and then the code itself in physics, 
this approach to development is very convenient, 
although at the end of the development I immediately wrote the code without checking

# and from myself
and I will add from myself, I have little experience in creating good programs,   
I donâ€™t know the development standards yet, this is my first program that I finished writing, I hope you enjoy it
